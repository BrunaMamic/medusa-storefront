## Description of project

This project is a simple storefront that displays products in a grid on the landing page and allows customers to visit a details page for each product. Customers can filter products by collection and choose among the available product variants.

### Time spent 
was approximately 1 week, with a few hours dedicated to the project per day, depending on other commitments and final exams.

### Most challenging implementation
was connecting Medusa server with Next.js app. It was my first time working with this kind of integration, so there was a learning curve involved in setting it up correctly. To accomplish that, I carefully followed the documentation and resources provided by Medusa.

### Most Proud Implementation
is the product details page and its functionality, which embodies a minimalistic and organized design approach. I have incorporated selectors for size and color, enabling customers to customize their product choices. Additionally, I have included a quantity selector for easy adjustment of desired quantities.

Also, one aspect I'm proud of is the inclusion of small images and arrow navigation for image browsing. This allows customers to easily view different angles or variations of the product .


## Project Structure and Considerations

The project follows a modular and component-based approach. Each component represents a specific feature or UI element.

Next.js was chosen as the framework for building the storefront due to its strong support for server-side rendering and optimized performance. The project utilizes the pre-built hooks library medusa-react to consume data from the Medusa Store API, enabling seamless integration between the frontend and backend. 

Tailwind CSS was used for styling, providing a utility-first approach and enabling rapid development with its extensive set of pre-defined classes.

TypeScript was adopted throughout the project to enhance code quality and catch potential errors during development. 

As for considerations, I prioritized the user experience and aimed for a clean and intuitive design. I focused on keeping the interface simple and easy to navigate, avoiding unnecessary clutter and distractions. This approach helps users find and interact with products effortlessly.
